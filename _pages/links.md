A curated collection of some of my favorite content from around the internet. Videos, blogposts, podcasts, and the like. I love when people share this kind of stuff with me - it helps me get to know people much faster when I can see where their real interests lie. 

[Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII) by Bret Victor. An inspiring talk about Bret's approach to life given through the lens of some magical software demos. Great video regardless of your interests really, but if you care about software design, tools for thought, or the future of programming, Bret is the guy. Check out his [blog](http://worrydream.com/).
