I always enjoy reading other people's book recommendations, so I'm using this page to list out some of my favorites.

I've definitely been influenced by Naval Ravikant's ideas on reading - I no longer feel any guilt about putting down a book that I'm not enjoying and I'm increasingly convinced that rereading the same ~100 books is a better use of time than constantly looking for a new one. 

## Books 

[Energy and Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Civilization-History-MIT-Press/dp/0262536161/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1622750365&sr=8-1) by Vaclav Smil. Figuring out to harness new sources of energy and use existing ones more efficiently is arguably the most foundational problem in the quest to improve the world. No other book I've read makes that more clear. Worth purchasing for the first and last chapter alone - they offer great mental models for thinking about these issues. The middle portion of the book offers more detail than you could ever hope to remember, but is full of great history nonetheless. 

[Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GA23TMA7S9UF&dchild=1&keywords=thinking+in+systems&qid=1622750889&sprefix=thinking+in+systems%2Caps%2C209&sr=8-1) by Donella Meadows. Great intro to systems thinking, a necessary skill if you wish to maybe possibly eventually have clear thoughts about anything at all. 

[Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3JLITERA1ZHNN&dchild=1&keywords=amusing+ourselves+to+death&qid=1622750982&sprefix=amusing+ourselves%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-1) by Neil Postman. First published in 1985, this book has proven to be extremely prescient about our descent into the world of infotainment. Whenever I think about ways the world has changed for the worse I go back to Postman's example about the [Lincoln-Douglas Debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debates) and compare them to modern political debates. 

[Musashi](https://www.amazon.com/Musashi-Epic-Novel-Samurai-Era/dp/156836427X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VXDQJQ5IGZL3&dchild=1&keywords=musashi&qid=1622751835&sprefix=musashi%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1) by Eiji Yoshikawa. Simply an epic story about the life of Japan's most famous ronin. 

[Stubborn Attachments](https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=stubborn+attachments&qid=1622752118&sr=8-1) by Tyler Cowen. A simple and short discussion of economic growth and why it is so important. I always remember this example from the book: "redo U.S. history, but assume the country's economy had grown one percentage point less each year between 1870 and 1990. In that scenario, the United States of 1990 would be no richer than the Mexico of 1990."

[Self Reliance](https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/essays/selfreliance.html) by Ralph Waldo Emerson. A great prescription for living well. 

[The Making of Prince of Persia](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Journals-1985-1993-Illustrated/dp/0578627310/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=making+of+prince+of+persia&qid=1622752890&sr=8-3) by Jordan Mechner. Jordan's annotated personal journals throughout the time he was making one of the all time great video games. Awesome inside look at the process of someone doing really difficult creative work. Read it in a day. 

[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World-ebook/dp/B005DXR5ZC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=21LD89Q5XARLZ&dchild=1&keywords=beginning+of+infinity+by+david+deutsch&qid=1622753104&sprefix=beginning+of+infinity%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-1) by David Deutsch. Deutsch's argument for why there are no limits to human knowledge. An extremely broad book that had me stopping to look things up constantly.

[A Mind at Play](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Play-Shannon-Invented-Information/dp/1476766681) by Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman. Highly enjoyable read about Claude Shannon and his life's work. The combination of his towering accomplishments and his lighthearted nature make for great inspiration.
