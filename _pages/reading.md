title: "Reading List"

I always enjoy reading other people's book recommendations, so I'm using this page to list out some of my favorites. I loved reading as a kid, but lost the habit in high school. I don't remember exactly why, but I picked it up big time again in college. Just about every non-athlete that I admire is known for being a prolific reader, so I figured I should do the same. 

I've definitely been influenced by Naval Ravikant's ideas on reading - I no longer feel any guilt about putting down a book that I'm not enjoying and I'm increasingly convinced that rereading the same ~100 books is a better use of time than constantly looking for a new one.
