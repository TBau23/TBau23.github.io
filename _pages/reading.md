I always enjoy reading other people's book recommendations, so I'm using this page to list out some of my favorites.

I've definitely been influenced by Naval Ravikant's ideas on reading - I no longer feel any guilt about putting down a book that I'm not enjoying and I'm increasingly convinced that rereading the same ~100 books is a better use of time than constantly looking for a new one.
