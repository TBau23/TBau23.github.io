Welcome! My name is Tom. I'm 23 years old and currently focused on learning as much as I can about building software. I studied finance and history in college, but after some internships and a lot of reading I realized I had no desire to follow the traditional finance career path. Instead, I enrolled in [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) just after graduation and recently completed their 9 month track in full stack development. 

I'm setting up this personal website to try and take better advantage of the magical tool that is the internet. My natural inclination is to not share much about myself, but I've been inspired by posts like [The Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) and Sam Hinkie's philosophy of leaving [breadcrumbs](https://www.stitcher.com/show/invest-like-the-best/episode/sam-hinkie-find-your-people-invest-like-the-best-ep-204-80161177). Writing (both code and words) is also a great way to expose sloppy thinking, so I'm hoping that creating this site will serve as a sort of forcing function for making me better at those skills. 

## Interests and Influences

An ongoing catalog of things that interest me. At some point I'd like to write longer form posts about a lot of these. 

- This long [essay](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) on improving memory by Michael Nielsen. I'm convinced that incorporating spaced repition into one's life is of potentially enormous value. We tend to think of memorizing things as dull, but the knowledge we carry around in our heads has a huge influence on the thoughts we're able to think. I'm trying to make spaced repetition a core habit.
    - Michael and Andy Matuschak are doing a lot of really interesting work around this idea. Here are some other [relevant](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) [links](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

    - Related is the idea of feedback loops in learning. 

- Economic and scientific history. This is an enormous category, 



- Sports.
