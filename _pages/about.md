Welcome! My name is Tom. I'm 23 years old and currently focused on learning as much as I can about building software. I studied finance and history in college, but after some internships and a lot of reading I realized I had no desire to follow the traditional finance career path. Instead, I enrolled in [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) just after graduation and recently completed their 9 month track in full stack development. 

I'm setting up this personal website to try and take better advantage of the magical tool that is the internet. My natural inclination is to not share much about myself, but I've been inspired by posts like [The Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) and Sam Hinkie's philosophy of leaving [breadcrumbs](https://www.stitcher.com/show/invest-like-the-best/episode/sam-hinkie-find-your-people-invest-like-the-best-ep-204-80161177). Writing (both code and words) is also a great way to expose sloppy thinking, so I'm hoping that creating this site will serve as a sort of forcing function for making me better at those skills. 

## Interests and Influences

An ongoing catalog of things that interest me. At some point I'd like to write longer form posts about a lot of these. This site is still very much in progress, so I'm sure I'll expand on these with time. 

- This long [essay](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) on improving memory by Michael Nielsen. I'm convinced that incorporating spaced repition into one's life is of potentially enormous value. We tend to think of memorizing things as dull, but the knowledge we carry around in our heads has a huge influence on the thoughts we're able to think. I'm trying to make spaced repetition a core habit.
    - Michael and Andy Matuschak are doing a lot of really interesting work around this idea. Here are some other [relevant](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) [links](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

    <!-- - Related is the idea of feedback loops in learning.  -->

- Progress studies. Understanding how we got where we are and how we can do more of that in the future seems extremely important. How can you look at this [chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia) and not be full of questions?
    - [Roots of Progress](https://rootsofprogress.org/) by Jason Crawford is a good blog on the topic. Many of the books on my reading list revolve around this as well. 

- Economic history (closely tied to the above). All of my favorite college courses were on this topic. 
    - The history of financial markets in particular never fails to amaze me. No other type of history shows so consistently how little humans have changed over the last [thousand](https://twitter.com/jposhaughnessy/status/1079801917755346944) years.

- Sports. In particular, I love soccer (Manchester United) and MMA. I'm aware that is a weird combo. I've always loved soccer and I just think MMA is the most difficult sport there is by far. I'm amazed by all of the people who do it.
